Image::Filter version 0.07
==========================

Image::Filter applies filters onto images. The included filters are still work
in development.

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

  gd2 lib - Thomas Boutell - http://www.boutell.com/gd/

NOTE: You need the gd2 lib (which handles truecolor). If you can't install a 
newer version for some reason, stick to Filter::Image 0.04.

WRITING YOUR OWN FILTER

This package includes a Image::Filter::Foo module, which can be used as 
template for your own filter. Consult the gd documentation on how to use 
specific pixel based routines. Image::Filter now does true color thanks to 
the new gdlib. Did I mention this module is work under development?
